  <h2>Bruno Alejandro Chavez Vidal</h2>
  <p> Hello everyone!I live in Lima,Peru; I have a major in Business Administration and<br>
     a diploma on Finances.</p>
  <p>I'm studing a 2 months course about digital content and the BYU's Web and Computer<br>
     Programming certificate program. Both will help me a lot in my current personal<br>
     projet which is to establish an e-commerce business based on providing fitness accesories<br>
     for the peruvian market</p>
  <p>One of my favorite hobbies is play videogames and second to that is researching about<br>
     any topic which at the moment is:<br>
     "Healthy habits to enhance cognitive abilities as a programmer"</p>
  <p>Currently i'm not a member of the church but i definetly liked the way it's community<br>
     view on study and work as divine tool's for our families well being.</p>
